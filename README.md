# pitchRollYaw
A pitch, roll, and yaw calculater.

It is used to determine the axis inclinations of a plane using three known points(Only 1 plane passes through 3 points). First, two vectors are defined from these points. The cross product of these vectors gives the normal vector of the plane. The angles are then calculated based on this normal vector.
