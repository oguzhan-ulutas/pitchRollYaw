# pitchRollYaw
A pitch, roll, and yaw calculater.

It is used to determine the axis inclinations of a plane using three known points(Only 1 plane passes through 3 points). First, two vectors are defined from these points. The cross product of these vectors gives the normal vector of the plane. The angles are then calculated based on this normal vector.

As an example, It can be used to calculate inclinations of bulleye.
